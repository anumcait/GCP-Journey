## 📅 Day-01: Introduction to Cloud and GCP  

### 🔹 What I Learnt Today
- **What is Cloud Computing?**  
  Cloud computing means renting servers, storage, and databases over the internet instead of owning them.  
  👉 *"Pay only for what you use — no upfront investment, no maintenance headache."*

- **Traditional IT vs Cloud**
  | Traditional IT | Cloud (GCP) |
  |----------------|-------------|
  | Buy servers upfront | Rent what you need |
  | Pay for peak capacity | Auto-scale as needed |
  | Manual setup | Automated provisioning |
  | High maintenance | Managed by Google |

- **Why GCP over AWS/Azure?**
  - Google-level infrastructure (used by YouTube, Gmail, Google Search)  
  - Powerful networking & AI/ML services  
  - Beginner-friendly UI + powerful CLI  
  - Cost-effective  
  - Trusted by giants like **META**  

- **Created Free GCP Account**
  - Signed up at [cloud.google.com/free](https://cloud.google.com/free)  
  - Verified with PAN & card (no charges until manual upgrade ✅)  

- **Explored GCP Console**
  - URL: [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com)  
  - Explored Compute, Storage, IAM, Billing  

- **Explored Cloud Shell**
  - Free VM in browser with 5GB storage  
  - Pre-installed `gcloud` CLI  
  - Commands I tried:  
    ```bash
    gcloud auth list
    gcloud config list
    ```
