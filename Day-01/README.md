# ☁️ My GCP Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal repository documenting my hands-on exploration of **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**. This space is a mix of study notes, CLI experiments, and reflections as I build toward Cloud & DevOps mastery.

## 📅 Day 01: Introduction to Cloud & GCP

### 🔹 Key Concepts Covered

- **What is Cloud Computing?**  
  Cloud computing allows users to access servers, storage, and databases over the internet—no need to own physical infrastructure.  
  👉 *"Use resources on demand. No upfront costs. No maintenance headaches."*

- **Traditional IT vs Cloud (GCP)**  
  | 🏢 Traditional IT | ☁️ Cloud (GCP) |
  |------------------|----------------|
  | Buy hardware | Rent resources |
  | Pay for peak usage | Auto-scale |
  | Manual setup | Automated provisioning |
  | High maintenance | Managed by Google |

- **Why GCP?**  
  - Backbone of Google services (Search, Gmail, YouTube)  
  - Advanced AI/ML and networking capabilities  
  - Clean UI + powerful CLI (`gcloud`)  
  - Cost-effective pricing  
  - Trusted by companies like **Meta**

- **Explored GCP Console**  
  - URL: [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com)  
  - Browsed Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, IAM, Billing

- **Cloud Shell Experience**  
  - Free browser-based VM with 5GB storage  
  - Pre-installed `gcloud` CLI  
  - Commands tried:
    ```bash
    gcloud auth list
    gcloud config list
    ```
