## ‚úÖ Answers

1. **Virtualization** is creating virtual versions of physical hardware, such as servers, storage, or networks.  
   **Example:** Running multiple virtual servers on a single physical server in GCP Compute Engine to save cost and resources.  

2. **Virtual Machine (VM)** is a software-based emulation of a physical computer.  
   **Importance:** VMs allow running multiple OS instances on a single physical server, enabling resource efficiency and isolation in cloud computing.  

3. **API (Application Programming Interface)** is a set of rules that allows software to communicate.  
   **GCP Usage:** GCP APIs allow developers to programmatically interact with cloud services like Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, BigQuery, etc., without using the console.  

4. **Regions vs Availability Zones (AZs):**  
   - **Region:** A geographical area where GCP data centers are located (e.g., `us-central1`).  
   - **AZ:** Isolated locations within a region, each with independent power, networking, and cooling.  

5. **Scalability vs Elasticity:**  
   - **Scalability:** Ability to increase resources to handle growth over time.  
     **Example:** Adding more VM instances for a growing e-commerce website.  
   - **Elasticity:** Automatic adjustment of resources based on current demand.  
     **Example:** Auto-scaling VM instances during festival sales traffic spikes.  

6. **Agility** is the ability to quickly deploy and adapt resources or applications.  
   **Example:** Spinning up new VMs or databases in minutes during a sudden project requirement.  

7. **High Availability (HA)** means a system is operational and accessible most of the time, typically 99.9% uptime.  
   **Practice:** Deploying application servers across multiple AZs ensures users can access the app even if one AZ fails.  

8. **Fault Tolerance vs Disaster Recovery:**  
   - **Fault Tolerance:** System continues running despite hardware/software failure.  
   - **Disaster Recovery:** Planned process to restore operations after major failure or disaster.  

9. **Disaster Recovery Importance:** Protects enterprise data and ensures business continuity in case of data loss, natural disaster, or cyber-attack.  

10. **Real-world Load Balancing Use Case:**  
    - **Scenario:** Streaming IPL matches to millions of viewers.  
    - **Solution:** Use GCP **Cloud Load Balancing** to distribute user requests evenly across multiple servers, ensuring smooth streaming without server overload.
