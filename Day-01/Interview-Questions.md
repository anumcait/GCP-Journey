### ‚úÖ Answers

Cloud: A virtual space to store and run apps/data online.

Cloud Computing: Delivery of IT services (servers, storage, apps) via the internet.

Difference (Cloud vs Traditional): Rent vs Buy, Auto-scale vs Manual setup.

Benefits: Cost-effective, scalable, global reach, high availability.

Pay-as-you-go: Pay only for the resources you consume.

Public Cloud: Shared by all users. Example: Gmail, AWS, GCP.

Private Cloud: Dedicated to one organization. Example: On-premises servers.

Hybrid Cloud: Combination of public and private.

Difference: Public = shared, Private = exclusive, Hybrid = mix.

Why GCP: Google infra, AI/ML strengths, cost-friendly, easy to use.

GCP Compute Services: Compute Engine, App Engine, Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Functions.

IAM in GCP: Identity and Access Management ‚Äì controls permissions.

Cloud Storage: Object storage for files, backups, images.

Cloud Shell: Browser-based terminal with gcloud pre-installed.

GCP Project: A logical container for resources, billing, and IAM.

Virtualization: Creating multiple virtual resources from one physical resource.

VM: Emulated computer with OS and apps.

API: Rules for software-to-software communication.

Regions: Geo areas with GCP data centers.

Zones: Subdivisions of regions for redundancy.

Scalability: Planned resource expansion.

Elasticity: Automatic resource adjustment.

Agility: Speed to deploy and adapt.

High Availability: 99.9% uptime, no downtime.

Fault Tolerance: Keeps working despite failures.

Disaster Recovery: Restores systems after disaster.

Load Balancing: Distributes traffic to multiple servers.

Scalability vs Elasticity: Scalability = capacity planning, Elasticity = auto-adjustment.

Fault Tolerance vs DR: Fault Tolerance = keep running, DR = recover after fail.

Load Balancing vs Auto-scaling: LB = distribute load, Auto-scaling = adjust number of servers.

Shared Responsibility: Cloud provider secures infra, user secures apps/data.
