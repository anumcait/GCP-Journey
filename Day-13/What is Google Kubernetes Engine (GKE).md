# Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) – Step by Step Guide

## Introduction
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) is a managed Kubernetes service provided by Google Cloud. It allows organizations to deploy, manage, and scale enterprise-grade Kubernetes clusters with ease.

GKE is popular because:
- It is backed by Google, the company that open-sourced Kubernetes.
- It provides automation for Kubernetes management, including control plane and data plane.
- It simplifies cluster scaling, upgrades, patching, and cost optimization.

## 1. Why Kubernetes?
### 1.1 Recap of Docker
Docker solves two major challenges:
1. **Portability** – Applications can run anywhere without worrying about OS differences or system dependencies.
2. **Resource utilization** – Multiple containers can run on a single VM with isolated resources.

### 1.2 Limitations of Containers
Containers are **not production-ready** due to:
- **Ephemeral nature** – Containers can crash or stop unexpectedly.
- **Service discovery issues** – Hard-coded IP addresses break when containers restart.
- **Lack of enterprise features** – Load balancing, high availability, reliability, and security need manual handling.

---

## 2. How Kubernetes Solves Container Problems
- **Pods** – Kubernetes runs containers inside pods, which ensure high availability.
- **ReplicaSets** – Ensure the desired number of pods are always running.
- **Cluster Architecture** – Kubernetes runs on multiple nodes (control plane + worker nodes) to handle scale and redundancy.
- **Load balancing** – Through **Ingress** or **Gateway API**, Kubernetes distributes traffic efficiently.
- **Security** – Namespace isolation, admission controllers, and best practices ensure secure deployments.

---

## 3. Challenges of Self-Hosted Kubernetes
- **Setup complexity** – Requires multiple control plane and worker nodes.
- **Cluster upgrades & patching** – Must manually track Kubernetes versions and security patches.
- **Cost optimization** – Manual scaling can lead to underutilized resources.
- **Subject matter expertise** – Requires experienced DevOps engineers to manage.

## 4. Advantages of Google Kubernetes Engine
### 4.1 Managed Kubernetes
GKE provides:
1. **Automated Kubernetes management** – Handles upgrades, patches, scaling.
2. **Control plane management** – Google maintains control plane nodes.
3. **Autopilot mode** – Google manages both control plane and data plane.
4. **Optimized VM selection** – GKE selects right VMs for workload.
5. **Cost efficiency** – Auto-scaling reduces wasted resources.

### 4.2 Modes of GKE
- **Standard Mode** – Manages only control plane.
- **Autopilot Mode** – Manages both control plane and worker nodes.

## 5. Practical Steps to Use GKE
1. Log in to Google Cloud Console.
2. Navigate to Kubernetes Engine → Clusters → Create Cluster.
3. Choose **Standard or Autopilot mode**.
4. Configure node pools, machine types, and scaling options.
5. Deploy applications using `kubectl apply -f <deployment.yaml>`.
6. Use **Ingress** or **Services** for load balancing.
7. Monitor cluster health using Google Cloud Console and Metrics.
