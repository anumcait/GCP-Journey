# ðŸš€ GCP Learning â€“ Day 2

On Day 2, I explored the **foundations of GCP resource organization, billing, and cost management**. These are critical for both day-to-day operations and cloud governance.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered

### 1. GCP Resource Hierarchy
- **Organization** â†’ Root node, tied to domain (e.g., example.com).
- **Folders** â†’ Optional grouping for business units, teams, or environments.
- **Projects** â†’ Logical containers for APIs, billing, and resources.
- **Resources** â†’ Actual services like VMs, storage buckets, databases, etc.

ðŸ”— **Comparison with other clouds**
- **AWS** â†’ Organization â†’ Accounts â†’ OUs â†’ Resources  
- **Azure** â†’ Management Groups â†’ Subscriptions â†’ Resource Groups â†’ Resources  
- **OCI** â†’ Tenancy â†’ Compartments â†’ Resources

### 2. Billing Setup
- Create a **billing account** and link it to projects.
- A project can have **only one billing account** at a time.
- Centralized billing for multiple projects is possible.

---

### 3. Billing Alerts & Budgets
- Define **budgets** with thresholds (e.g., 50%, 80%, 100%).  
- Configure **alerts** via:
  - Email notifications
  - Pub/Sub for automation
  - Cloud Monitoring dashboards
- Helps prevent surprise bills.

---

### 4. Cost Optimization Strategies
- Right-size compute/database resources.
- Use **preemptible VMs** for short-lived, fault-tolerant jobs.
- Apply **committed use discounts (CUDs)** and **sustained use discounts (SUDs)**.
- Automate shutdown for idle dev/test environments.
- Regularly review billing reports to remove unused resources.

---

### 5. Enable Essential APIs
- Many GCP services require APIs to be enabled before use:
  ```bash
  gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com \
    storage.googleapis.com \
    cloudbilling.googleapis.com \
    billingbudgets.googleapis.com
