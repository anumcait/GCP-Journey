## üß© Conceptual Questions

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is Docker and why do we use it?
Docker is a **containerization platform** that packages applications with all dependencies into a lightweight, portable unit called a **container**.  
It ensures that software runs consistently across environments ‚Äî solving the ‚ÄúIt works on my machine‚Äù problem.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ What problem does Docker solve?
1. **Environment inconsistency:** Same app runs differently in dev vs prod ‚Üí Docker eliminates this.  
2. **Resource utilization:** Multiple lightweight containers can run on a single host without separate OS overhead.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ What‚Äôs the difference between a container and a virtual machine?
| Virtual Machine | Docker Container |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Heavy (runs full OS per VM) | Lightweight (shares host OS kernel) |
| Slow startup | Fast startup |
| Uses GBs of memory | Uses MBs of memory |
| Example: VMware, VirtualBox | Example: Docker, Podman |

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ What is a Docker image?
A Docker image is a **read-only template** containing instructions for creating a container ‚Äî like a snapshot of the app‚Äôs filesystem, libraries, and runtime.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ What is a Docker container?
A Docker container is a **running instance of an image**.  
It runs isolated from other containers but shares the same OS kernel.

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ What is a Dockerfile?
A **Dockerfile** is a text file containing build instructions (e.g., base image, dependencies, ports, and startup command).

Example:
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```
### 7Ô∏è‚É£ What is a Multi stage Dockerfile?
A **multi-stage** build allows
