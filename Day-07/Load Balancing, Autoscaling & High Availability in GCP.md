# üå§Ô∏è Day 7 ‚Äì Load Balancing, Autoscaling & High Availability in GCP

In this session, we explore three essential pillars of cloud scalability and reliability using a **Walmart e-commerce demo** as an example.

## üß© 1. Load Balancing

**Definition:**  
A Load Balancer distributes incoming network traffic across multiple virtual machines (VMs) or application instances to ensure that no single instance is overwhelmed.

**Real-life Analogy:**  
Like a store manager directing customers to different checkout counters to avoid long queues.

**In GCP:**  
- Implemented using **Backend Services** under the **Load Balancer**.  
- Supports multiple algorithms (Round Robin, Ratio-based, Weighted).  
- Improves performance and fault tolerance.

**Example:**  
Walmart‚Äôs website runs on two VMs in the same region.  
The Load Balancer splits traffic (1000 users ‚Üí 500 each) automatically.

## üß± 2. High Availability (HA)

**Definition:**  
Ensures your application remains available even if a zone or data center fails.

**In GCP:**  
- Deploy VMs in **multiple availability zones** within a region.  
- Load Balancer routes requests to healthy zones.  
- Can extend globally with **Global Load Balancer**.

**Example:**  
If one Walmart data center (Zone A) fails due to outage,  
traffic automatically shifts to another (Zone B) with no downtime.

## üöÄ 3. Autoscaling

**Definition:**  
Automatically adjusts the number of VM instances in response to traffic load.

**In GCP:**  
- Achieved using **Managed Instance Groups (MIGs)**.  
- Uses **Instance Templates** to define VM configurations.  
- Scales **up** when CPU utilization crosses a threshold (e.g., 80%).  
- Scales **down** when load decreases.

**Example:**  
During Walmart‚Äôs flash sale, if user count spikes from 1,000 to 10,000,  
Autoscaling adds new VMs automatically to handle traffic.

## üîÅ Combined Power

| Feature | Role | GCP Component |
|----------|------|---------------|
| Load Balancing | Distributes traffic | Backend Service / Load Balancer |
| High Availability | Keeps service running during failures | Multi-Zone / Multi-Region setup |
| Autoscaling | Adjusts capacity automatically | Managed Instance Groups (MIG) |

---

## üß† Key Takeaways
- Load Balancer = Smart Traffic Controller  
- High Availability = Reliability and Uptime  
- Autoscaling = Cost-Effective Performance  
- Together ‚Üí They ensure your cloud application is **resilient, scalable, and efficient**.
